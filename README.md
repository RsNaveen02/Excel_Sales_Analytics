The provided Excel workbooks, exported as PDFs, summarize Atliq Hardwares’ financial performance across markets and regions, serving as tools for both annual profitability analysis and quarterly trend monitoring.
The first file, “P&L for Markets” for FY 2021, presents a detailed Profit and Loss breakdown by individual country markets. For each market, the table lists four key financial metrics:
Net Sales – the total revenue generated in USD millions.
COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) – the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold.
Gross Margin – the difference between Net Sales and COGS, showing the absolute profit before other operating expenses.
GM% (Gross Margin Percentage) – the Gross Margin as a percentage of Net Sales, indicating profitability efficiency.
For example, in FY 2021, India recorded the highest Net Sales at 161.26M USD with a GM% of 32.0%, while New Zealand, with 11.40M USD in sales, achieved the highest GM% of 48.2%. This sheet enables stakeholders to compare market performances, identify strong profit contributors, and detect areas of lower margin efficiency
